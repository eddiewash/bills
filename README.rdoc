Project is used to help showcase my growing skills using Ruby, Rails, JQuery, Javascript, HTML and CSS. The project is a work in progress but in a couple of weeks hopefully it will show my potential to get hired as a junior developed. If you like what you see, give me a shout, I'm definitely looking for an opportunity to join a great team.
